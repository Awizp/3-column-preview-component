# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

1. This component responsive for any devices started with desktop first approach.
2. Then I used display: flex method to align cards and add flex-basis at 50% when width down to 900px.
3. I have added background images when hover that cards and put the opacity to 0.6 to view text easily.
4. I have added media queries with BEM method in SCSS to change the responsive for any devices from 400px to 1440px.

Languages I used for this component,
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. SCSS

All feedback is greatly appreciated!
